    - Enigma
    - This is it...
    - I should go over the plan.
    - I've got two minutes before I need to be back in the main concert hall for
      my performance.
    - The door that the gem is locked behind has a fancy mechanism. It needs a code
      to unlock, not just lockpicks. And they change the code every day.
    - Luckily, the concert hall owner has recently become convinced that her memory
      isn't very good.
    - Things not being where she left them... meetings not being at the times she
      thought they were...
    - And a well-timed comment from one of the cleaners saying that they always write
      down the important things they want to remember.
    - Heh.
    - The code is written down on a piece of paper that she keeps inside her desk.
    - Then from there, it's a quick jaunt over to where the gem is locked up, then
      back into the concert hall.
    - Between here and there, there should be three, maybe four guards.
    - Just don't get caught.
    - Got the code.
    - I don't like the look of that hallway, though...
    - There's a part where the hallway turns that doesn't seem very well lit. Maybe
      if I walk up to it and press SHIFT I can slip into the shadows?
    - This is the mechanism for opening the door.
    - All I have to do is input the code I found by pressing E...
    - And there we go. Heh.
    - Beautiful craftsmanship on this one. Shame they wanted to keep it locked away
      in here, hm?
    - Looks like I'm just in time. If I head straight through here, I'll make it
      back to the main concert hall in time for my performance.
    - Time to put on a show.
